<h1>üåç Global ESG Data Analysis and Benchmarking üìä

  
<h2>Project Overview üéØ
  
<h3>The core objective is to convert complex, multi-dimensional ESG data into clear, visually compelling insights that answer critical questions about country performance and global trends.

Key Analytical Goals:

Geographic Assessment: Identify which countries lead or lag in overall ESG performance.

Time Trends: Analyze how performance on key indicators (e.g., renewable energy use, internet access) has changed over time.

Correlation Analysis: Examine the relationship between different indicators (e.g., Energy Use vs. Life Expectancy) to identify drivers of successful policy outcomes.

Benchmarking: Provide clear rankings of the top and bottom countries for any selected indicator.

<h2>Tools & Technologies üõ†Ô∏è
  
<h3>Category	Tool/Metrics	Focus Area
Primary Tool	Tableau	Dashboard development and interactive visualization
Data Preparation	Data Joins, Calculated Fields	Data structuring and creating the ESG Pillar category
Key Dimensions	Country, Series Code, Year, Pillar (E, S, G)	Core fields for filtering and comparison


<h2>Process ‚öôÔ∏è
<h3>The project assumes a multi-file data structure (an indicator metadata file combined with a values data file) and focuses on analytical structure within Tableau:

<h2>1. Data Preparation (Assumed) üßπ
<h3>Data Joining: Linking the indicator metadata (which contains the DESCRIPTION and SeriesCode) with the assumed data file containing the actual Value.

Type Conversion: Ensuring that the Value field (the numerical indicator score) is correctly set as a Decimal Number.

Calculated Fields: Creating a calculated Pillar field (categorizing each indicator as E for Environmental, S for Social, or G for Governance) to enable high-level analysis and filtering.

<h2>2. Dashboard Structure and Visualization üìä
   
<h3>The dashboard is structured into two main tabs to facilitate both a quick overview and a deep dive:

Overview: Geographic and Ranking

Geographic Assessment (Map): A color-coded view of global performance for a user-selected indicator.

Top/Bottom 10 List (Bar Chart): Ranks the top and bottom 10 countries for the selected indicator, enabling quick benchmarking.

Deep Dive: Trend and Correlation

Time Series Trend (Line Chart): Shows the historical change in an indicator over time for a selected country to assess progress or decline.

Correlation Scatter Plot: Used to analyze the relationship between two different indicators (e.g., CO2 Emissions vs. GDP per Capita) to identify policy correlations.

<h2>Key Insights üí°
<h3>The dashboard empowers stakeholders to rapidly identify and act on ESG data:

Policy Success/Failure: The Time Series Trend allows for instant visual assessment of whether a country‚Äôs policy changes have resulted in an improved or worsened indicator score.

Identifying Policy Drivers: The Scatter Plot helps to establish potential causal relationships or correlations between indicators, guiding policymakers on where to focus investment (e.g., investing in education to improve health outcomes).

Investment Screening: Investors can quickly screen and benchmark countries to ensure capital is directed toward regions that align with their specific E, S, or G criteria.

<h2>Future Work üöÄ
<h3>Forecasting: Integrate predictive models to forecast future ESG indicator values based on historical trends.

Custom Scoring: Allow users to define custom weights for different indicators to generate a personalized Composite ESG Score for each country.

Data Source Automation: Implement a process to automatically update the dashboard with new quarterly/annual data releases from the World Bank or similar sources.
